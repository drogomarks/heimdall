# heimdall
Rackspace Email &amp; Apps API Tool

Heimdall is a simple PHP application that makes requests to the Rackspace Email & Apps API following the documentation here: http://api-wiki.apps.rackspace.com

It's only depencies are PHP as everything is just Bootstrap. 

I'm not a real developer, so if someting is broken please let me know. Also mobile version of this is all borked and I was too dumb to set up git before that happened so no way to roll back whatever broke it. I'll just build a mobile version of the site.

## To-do
* Write JS to put output into same page and container where the call is made, rather than a new tab
* Create mobile optimized site
* Log "Feature Requests" in MySQL database 
* Put up a scripts page, with Pyton or Bash scripts that allow the constructing of calls via args
